Hello,

This program requires Selenium and Pytest. You can find 'requirements.txt' in the package.
To run the file, please go to the terminal, switch to the directory '/Peek_framework/tests' and run the command 'pytest test_report.py -v'.
After the program is done, you'll be able to see the total number of tests as 'collected 12 items', the number of failed tests, the number of passed tests and the assertions with expected and discovered (you can find the screenshots in the package).
There are much more test cases that are possible to create for these user stories in the future.

I found several issues on the website which made several test cases fail due to an issue in the search. There are more issues which I can talk about on the interview. 
Please, let me know if you have any questions.
